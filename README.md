## Mentioned below are the maximum score for each issue:
- Easy - 30
- Medium - 50
- Difficult - 70 
- Very Difficult - 100
###### You will be provided maximum score only if the issue will be completely resolved. Partial scoring will be awarded in all other circumstances.

## Rules:
- **Calculation of the final scores** will be based on the number of commits you will be able to merge related to issues.
- The commits will be merged only when your code is found to be accurately relevant to the issue the commit is related to.
- In case if more than one person is solving a single issue, **the best committed code will be merged**, FCFM(First Commit First Merge) will not be entertained.

## For Doubts and Discussions:
- You can comment on the issue itself.
- You can also join our [Slack Forum](https://join.slack.com/t/codeasylumshq/shared_invite/zt-fe4lgwn8-m30vZDFqE77jsGu21KC8tw)
